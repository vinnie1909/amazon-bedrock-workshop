    "# Question and answers with Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "Question Answering (QA) is an important task that involves extracting answers to factual queries posed in natural language. Typically, a QA system processes a query against a knowledge base containing structured or unstructured data and generates a response with accurate information. Ensuring high accuracy is key to developing a useful, reliable and trustworthy question answering system, especially for enterprise use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI models like Titan and Claude use probability distributions to generate responses to questions. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data, which allows them to predict what comes next in a sequence or what word might follow a particular word. However, these models are not able to provide accurate or deterministic answers to every question because there is always some degree of uncertainty in the data. Enterprises need to query domain specific and proprietary data and use the information to answer questions, and more generally data on which the model has not been trained on. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we will demonstrate how to use the Bedrock Titan model to provide information response to queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will be running the Model with no context and then manually try and provide the context. There is no `RAG` augmentation happening here. This approach works with short documents or single-ton applications, it might not scale to enterprise level question answering where there could be large enterprise documents which cannot all be fit into the prompt sent to the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "- How to have the model return factual answers for question\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposal\n",
    "To the above challenges, this notebook proposes the following strategy\n",
    "#### Prepare documents\n",
    "Before being able to answer the questions, the documents must be processed and a stored in a document store index\n",
    "- Here we will send in the request with the full relevant context to the model and expect the response back\n"
