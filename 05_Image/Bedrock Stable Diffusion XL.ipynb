    "## Introduction to Bedrock - Generating images using Stable Diffusion\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this demo notebook, we demonstrate how to use the Bedrock SDK for an image generation task. We show how to use the Stable Diffusion foundational model to create images\n",
    "1. Text to Image\n",
    "2. Image to Image\n",
    "\n",
    "Images in Stable Diffusion are generated by these 4 main models below\n",
    "1. The CLIP text encoder;\n",
    "2. The VAE decoder;\n",
    "3. The UNet, and\n",
    "4. The VAE_post_quant_conv\n",
    "\n",
    "These blocks are chosen because they represent the bulk of the compute in the pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "see this diagram below\n",

    "#### Image prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a good prompt can sometime be an art. It is often difficult to predict whether a certain prompt will yield a satisfactory image with a given model. However, there are certain templates that have been observed to work. Broadly, a prompt can be roughly broken down into three pieces: (i) type of image (photograph/sketch/painting etc.), (ii) description (subject/object/environment/scene etc.) and (iii) the style of the image (realistic/artistic/type of art etc.). You can change each of the three parts individually to generate variations of an image. Adjectives have been known to play a significant role in the image generation process. Also, adding more details help in the generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a realistic image, you can use phrases such as “a photo of”, “a photograph of”, “realistic” or “hyper realistic”. To generate images by artists you can use phrases like “by Pablo Piccaso” or “oil painting by Rembrandt” or “landscape art by Frederic Edwin Church” or “pencil drawing by Albrecht Dürer”. You can also combine different artists as well. To generate artistic image by category, you can add the art category in the prompt such as “lion on a beach, abstract”. Some other categories include “oil painting”, “pencil drawing, “pop art”, “digital art”, “anime”, “cartoon”, “futurism”, “watercolor”, “manga” etc. You can also include details such as lighting or camera lens such as 35mm wide lens or 85mm wide lens and details about the framing (portrait/landscape/close up etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that model generates different images even if same prompt is given multiple times. So, you can generate multiple images and select the image that suits your application best."
